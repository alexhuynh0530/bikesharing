# An Analysis of NYC Citibike Bikesharing Data using Tableau

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This is an analysis of New York City's CitiBike bikesharing data using Tableau to create visualizations that will help attract funding to potentially start a bikesharing service in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

Using tableau to create visualizations we found that:

- Total number of trips in August was 2,344,224

- 1,900,359 users were subscribers and 443,865 users were customers.

- The peak number of users had a tripduration of 5 minutes.

- The largest number of individuals are male and the peak tripduration for women is 6 minutes while the peak for men is 5 minutes.

- Thursday has the most trips with 5-6 PM having the most trips.

- Males have higher usage and on the weekend the trips seemed disperesed throughout the daytime between 8am-7pm while weekdays seem concentrated at 8am and 5-6pm.

- When comparing female, male and unknown customers, unknown customers have the highest number of trips with most of the trips made on the weekends.

## Summary

In summary, we found that most users are male. We could assume that users mostly use bikes during the weekday to commute to work since the highest number of trips were made at 8am and 5-6pm. We also know that the peak number of users have a trip duration of about 5 minutes. If Des Moines has a lot of workers that commute to work that could use the bikesharing service to commute with an average bike trip time of 5 minutes, then it could be a good opportunity to open their own bikesharing service.
